     <!--Introduction and game description-->
      <p class="info">
        This game aims to sharpen your memory by allowing you to match card
        pairs of famous international rugby union players. Each pair is randomly placed on the board
        and the game ends in 50 seconds. Not quite test match rugby but still a
        good mental workout to sharpen memory.
