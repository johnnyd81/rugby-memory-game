# Rugby memory game

This app allows a user to test their recall ability by flipping cards to find matching pairs. The game has a timer that adds a bit of a challenge to beat the clock before it expires.
Each card is visible for a short time after being clicked to help with recalling it's position in the board. The app was built using HTML, CSS and javaScript.
