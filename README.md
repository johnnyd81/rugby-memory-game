# Rugby memory game

This app enables a user to test their recall ability by flipping cards to find matching pairs on the game board. The game has a timer that allows 50 seconds to find all the matching cards. When the timer runs out the user has the option to restart the game and in so doing the cards are rearranged on the game board. When a card is clicked it remains visible for a short period of time after being clicked to help with recalling it's position in the board. The app was built using the technologies HTML, CSS and javaScript.
